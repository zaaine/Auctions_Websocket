# Digging WebSockets
> Hey team ! What's up ? Et oui, a l'approche de la fin de formation on va corser un petit peu les choses. Pour cette activitÃ© transverse, le contenu va vous Ãªtre donner en anglais. L'objectif est de bien sÃ»r de se prÃ©parer pour le questionnaire professionnel. Bon courage !

Hi everybody! Today we're going to explore a super cool feature for instant communication between backend and frontends: **WebSockets**.

You might be thinking, "That's only for chat applications, and I don't need to code a chat...", but you'll see the power of WebSockets during this workshop. First of all, read some documentation about this protocol:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)
* [MDN: Writing WebSocket client app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_client_applications)
* [MDN: Writing WebSocket server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers)

## Goals

This workshop has multiple objectives. All the code (backend and frontend) will be written in Vanilla JavaScript - no framework, no ORM! Don't worry about style; it's only a Proof Of Concept ðŸ˜Ž.

The app built is an eBay-like auction system. Your job is to achieve these 3 steps:

1. Run the app and play with the bidding system. It's a containerized app using Docker and Docker Compose. You can see in `docker-compose.yml` four services: socketserver, backend, database, and webserver (frontend). Take care of the `.env.example` files! You need to open multiple windows to simulate multiple users ðŸ˜‰.
2. Explore and review the code. It's pure Vanilla JavaScript with as few dependencies as possible, like in "the good old days" ðŸŽ¶. It's a great way to understand how each part works. Don't forget to inspect `SQL/create_tables.sql`; you will discover some rules and triggers ðŸ˜±.
3. Finally, add a feature to the frontend. We want to show a log view to see the contents of the `auction_logs` table. Obviously, use WebSockets to watch each change ðŸ¤“.

## Tips

### Run the app

You only need to run `docker compose up` and go to `localhost:8080` to see the frontend.

### Understand architecture

![Application architecture](architecture.drawio.png)

### Add HTML page

You only need to create HTML files in the `docker_config/nginx/views` folder. There is no router, so all links will be like `<a href="file.html">`.

### Add CSS / JS

Add some files into `docker_config/nginx/assets/*`. Warning, URLs are absolute, like `rel="/assets/js/file.css"`.


### How to start
1- configure .env
2- Docker compose up 
3- localhost:8100 for Adminer
4- localhost: 8084 for frontend
5- localhost: 3000 for data view
